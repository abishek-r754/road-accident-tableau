A data visualization project using Tableau to analyze road accident patterns, highlighting casualties, vehicle types, and contributing conditions for actionable insights

Road Accident Dashboard
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing road accident data by creating an interactive Tableau dashboard. The main objective of this project is to provide a clear understanding of accident patterns, yearly trends, and categories of accidents in a simple and visual format.

Road accidents are one of the major concerns in transportation and traffic management. Having a well-designed dashboard helps in quickly identifying the number of accidents across years and categories. It also supports exploring insights in a more effective way compared to raw data.

The dashboard was built with a focus on:

Simplicity in design.

Clear representation of accident statistics.

Easy interaction for exploring data.

By using Tableau, this project makes it possible to visually explore accident data without the need for coding, making it accessible to a wider audience.

Objectives

To build a visual representation of road accident data.

To show accident counts across years.

To provide trend analysis of road accidents.

To create an interactive dashboard that can be used by anyone to explore the dataset.

Tools Used
